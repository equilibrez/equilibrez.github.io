## Structural Vocabulary Defined

### 1. Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 (The Structural Hierarchy)

These **Tier classifications** are used to categorize the importance and urgency of needs and tasks, prioritizing foundational safety before complexity.

* **Tier 1 (Somatic/Physical Safety):**
    * **Focus/Domain:** The body, immediate environment, and nervous system.
    * **Core Goal:** **Stability and Survival.** This is the foundation that must be addressed first.
    * **Example Action:** Deploying the **Diaphragm Check**, recognizing hunger, managing physical tension, securing a safe living space.

* **Tier 2 (Structural Autonomy/Function):**
    * **Focus/Domain:** Resources, skills, routine, and independence.
    * **Core Goal:** **Functionality and Future Security.** This requires stability from Tier 1.
    * **Example Action:** Executing the **5-Minute Rule** on your work, tidying home, maintaining structured routines, seing trusted and supportive friends.

* **Tier 3 (Cognitive/Relational Insight):**
    * **Focus/Domain:** High-level analysis, long-term planning, and social relationships.
    * **Core Goal:** **Growth and Mastery.** This requires stability and resources from Tier 2.
    * **Example Action:** Analyzing complex structural concepts (e.g., Chaos vs. Scarcity), defining the **"Unassailable Stability" Signal.**

> **Structural Rule:** If a **Tier 1** need is compromised (e.g., severe anxiety, lack of sleep), it must be prioritized before any work or high-level planning (Tier 2/3).
