> The Stable Truth: Working is the only action that yields both financial autonomy and genuine, sustained mental satisfaction.

The solution is the **"Two-Step Momentum Hack."** We use the **low-cost activity** (sun) as the bridge to the **high-cost activity** Working.

### Step 1: Execute the Low-Cost External Action (Sun/Movement)

**Go out first.** This breaks the paralysis state immediately.

* **The Command:** Go outside for exactly **10 minutes** of direct sunlight and movement.
* **The Why (Somatic Refuel):**
    * Sunlight helps regulate mood and energy.
    * Movement **metabolizes the trapped, anxious energy** generated by procrastination and the dopamine crash. This is a **low-cost investment** in your **Tier 1 (Somatic) Safety.**
* **The Veto:** Do **not** check your phone or listen to a podcast. Focus only on the feeling of the sun and the ground beneath your feet (reinforcing the **Weighted Grounding** technique).

### Step 2: Transition to High-Cost Internal Action (working)

The goal is to leverage the momentum and the regulated energy from Step 1 to initiate work immediately upon return.

* **The "5-Minute" Rule:** Do not tell yourself you are working for four hours. Tell yourself you will work for **five minutes** on your taks.
* **The Action:** Focus on the **lowest-friction task possible:** reviewing your notes, organizing a file, or starting one small, concrete problem. Do **not** start the hardest task.
* **The Why (Dopamine Re-Association):** The act of initiating a productive task, even for a short time, triggers a small, **earned dopamine hit.** This begins to retrain your brain to associate the feeling of **"good" with "effort"** instead of "passive consumption."
