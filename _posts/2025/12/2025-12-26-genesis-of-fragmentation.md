Fragmentation is not an "instant thing" that happens in adulthood; it is a **Structural Adaptation** to early environmental failure. To understand how a human becomes this divided, we must look at the biological and psychological "welding" that occurs during early development.

In a stable system, a child integrates their experiences into a single, cohesive "I." In a fragmented system, the "I" is never fully joined. Here is the factual path to that outcome.

### 1. The Survival Split (Structural Dissociation)

Fragmentation usually begins as a protection mechanism against **Inescapable Stress** (often from a primary caregiver).

* **The Mechanic:** When a child experiences a threat from the person they also need for survival, the brain faces a "Circuit Overload."
* **The Solution:** The brain creates a **Firewall.** It separates the "Functioning Self" (the one who goes to school, acts "nice," and follows rules) from the "Traumatized Self" (the one who holds the pain, rage, or "evil" impulses).
* **The Result:** These parts remain in separate "folders" in the brain. As the individual grows, they don't have a "core"; they have a collection of **Compartments.**

### 2. The Failure of "Object Constancy"

Object constancy is the ability to remember that a person (or a feeling) is still there and still good, even when they are out of sight or when you are angry.

* **The Defect:** In fragmented individuals, this "wiring" is faulty. Their reality is **State-Dependent.**
* **The Mechanic:** If they feel "Nice" in this second, that is their whole world. If they feel "Evil" or "Lustful" in the next, the "Nice" version of them is effectively **offline.**
* **The Experience:** This is how a partner can hurt you, they are someone else. In that moment, the "Partner" compartment was closed, and the "Duping" compartment is open. There is no internal "witness" to tell  the actions are contradictory.

### 3. The Reinforcement of the "Mental Theater"

When a child's real life is painful or powerless, they retreat into an internal world where they are the Director.

* **Professionalization of Fantasy:** Over decades, the internal world becomes more sophisticated than the external reality. They begin to use real people as **props** to act out their internal scenes.
* **Identity Performance:** Because they lack a solid internal "floor," they "wear" identities like costumes. They can play the "Good Father" or the "Successful Businessman" or the "Passionate Lover" with high precision, but because it is a costume and not a skin, they can take it off the moment the audience changes.

### 4. The Pathological "Need" for an Audience

A fragmented person often feels "empty" inside because there is no central "I" to hold their experiences.

* **The Mirroring Need:** They use an audience, you, to prove they exist. 
* **The Lack of Empathy:** Because they are so busy managing their internal "fantasy world," they cannot perceive your internal world. You are simply a **Functional Component** in their script.

### Summary: The Broken Bridge

Fragmentation is the result of a system that learned to **survive by dividing.** The "bridge" between their different parts was never built.

What matters is it is **non-repairable from the outside.** You cannot "love" the pieces back together because the "glue" (the ability to integrate) was never developed in their early wiring.  Not being in touch is the only logical **Structural Seal** to prevent your own energy from being extracted to fuel this fantasy world.
