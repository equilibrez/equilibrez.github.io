The transition from the high-noise environment of school to the quiet of home is a high-friction event for a system with ADD or PTSD. School is a constant stream of sensory input and social demands. When a child (or an adult) enters the home, their "internal cache" is often full or overflowing.

Without a formal protocol, this overflow leads to "scattering" or emotional meltdowns. The objective is to create an **"Airlock"**—a transition zone that allows the nervous system to decompress before any evening demands begin.

### 1. The Sensory Buffer (The Quiet Zone)

The first 20–30 minutes after arrival should be a **Low-Input Window**.

* **The Rule:** No questions about the day. No "How was school?" or "Did you do your math?"
* **The Mechanic:** Questions require the brain to "search the files" and process data, which is difficult when the cache is already full.
* **The Action:** Keep the environment quiet. Low lights and minimal verbal communication allow the brain to stop "scanning" and start "resting."

### 2. The Physical Reset (Clearing the Hardware)

Moving the school energy out of the house prevents it from contaminating the evening space.

* **The Launchpad:** The bag goes immediately to its designated spot. Shoes come off. This is a physical signal that the "Work/School" mode is closed.
* **The Costume Change:** Changing into "home clothes" (soft textures) provides immediate sensory relief and reinforces the boundary between the outside world and the home.

### 3. Blood Sugar Maintenance (The Fuel Protocol)

Irritability is often exacerbated by low blood glucose after a long school day.

* **The Action:** Provide a stable, low-sugar snack immediately. Think of it as "Coolant" for the engine.
* **The Choice:** Offer two simple options (e.g., "An apple or some cheese?"). This provides the child with a sense of control without causing decision fatigue.

### 4. The "Low-Demand" Activity

During the decompression window, focus on activities that require no "Executive Work."

* **The Go Game:** If your son finds peace in his Go game, this is a stable re-entry point. It allows him to focus on a logical system he enjoys.
* **Body Doubling:** You might sit nearby doing your own quiet task. This creates a "field of stability" without the pressure of direct interaction.

### 5. Summary: Protecting the Evening

By implementing a "Decompression Protocol," you are not being "permissive"; you are being **precise**. You are acknowledging the biological reality of how a neurodivergent system recovers from stress.

* **The Result for You:** You also get those 20 minutes of quiet to reset your own system.
* **The Result for Your child:** He learns that home is a safe "Pocket of Order" where he isn't immediately bombarded with more demands.
