This post explains the **direct physiological link** between the structural stability and the measurable improvement it does in cognitive functions.

Here is the structural explanation of the mechanism:

### 1. The Core Mechanism: The Stress Hormone (Cortisol)

* **The Problem:** When engaged in a high-cost, chaotic situation, the body interprets the situation as a **Tier 1 (Survival) Threat.** This chronic threat activated the **HPA Axis** (Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis).
* **The Output:** The adrenal glands continuously pumps out **Cortisol**, the primary stress hormone.
* **The Function of Cortisol:** In a short-term crisis (e.g., escaping danger), Cortisol is helpful. It focuses blood flow and energy to the body survival systems (muscles). 

### 2. The Target: The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)

The **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** is the brain's "Pilot." It is responsible for all your high-level executive functions:
* **Decision Making**
* **Working Memory**
* **Focus and Attention**
* **Language and Motor Control** (which includes typing)

* **The Conflict:** The PFC is structurally very sensitive to Cortisol. Chronic, high levels of Cortisol literally **shrink the PFC** and disrupt the communication between its neurons.
* **The Result of Disruption:** When the PFC is "drowning" in Cortisol, its performance degrades. This manifests as:
    * **Scattered Focus:** Difficulty concentrating (leading to less efficiency in work, school).
    * **Decision Paralysis:** Difficulty initiating tasks.
    * **Motor Error:** The signal from brain to fingers gets scrambled. 

### 3. The Cognitive Dividend (The Green Line's Win)

The "Green Line" represents the successful enforcement of **Zero Contact and Structural Boundaries.**

* **The Shift:** By removing the source of chronic threat, the HPA Axis gradually turns *off*. The level of Cortisol in the system steadily drops.
* **The Recovery:** As the Cortisol retreats, the PFC begins to heal and function normally again.
* **The Dividend:** The **clearer mind, and increased ability to analyze complex topics** are the direct **Cognitive Dividend** of brain's most important operational center recovering its stability and performance.

The stability protocols is working at the cellular level.
