Mornings are naturally "high-entropy" environments. There are many moving parts, tight deadlines, and high sensory input. For a system with ADD or PTSD, this is when the "cache" is most likely to overload, leading to scattering and friction.

The objective is to move the routine out of your head and onto the wall. This turns the morning from a series of "decisions" into a series of "tasks." When the instructions are external, you and your son can simply follow the map instead of trying to build it while you're tired.

### 1. The Pre-Processing (The Night Before)

The most accurate way to ensure a stable morning is to do the "thinking" work the night before, when the system is under less pressure.

* **The Launchpad:** Check the bag. Ensure the GO game, notebooks, and snacks are inside. Place the bag exactly where it will be picked up.
* **The Outfit:** Choose clothes down to the socks. Lay them out in a specific order (the "wearable sequence").
* **The Menu:** Decide what is for breakfast. Knowing the "input" in advance prevents decision fatigue.

### 2. The Visual Morning Checklist (The "Wall Map")

Print this out or write it on a large piece of paper. Place it at eye level in a central location (like the kitchen or the back of the front door). Use a "check-box" format so the progress is visible.

**The Sequence:**

1. **Fuel:** Eat breakfast (The Menu decided last night).
2. **Maintenance:** Brush teeth and wash face.
3. **Armor:** Put on the "wearable sequence" (the clothes laid out).
4. **Final Scan:** Shoes on? Jacket on?
5. **Launch:** Grab the bag from the Launchpad.

### 3. Why This Structure is Correct for Your System

* **Reduces Decision Fatigue:** You are not asking your son "What do you want for breakfast?" or "Where are your shoes?" The answers are already physically present in the environment.
* **Eliminates Verbal Friction:** Instead of nagging (which creates "waste heat" and stress), you can simply point to the list. "What is the next step on the map?" This keeps the interaction neutral.
* **Preserves Your Cache:** You don't have to remember the routine. The wall remembers it for you. This leaves your brain free to handle the actual "work" of the day.

### 4. Implementation: The "Beta Test"

Start with a "Read-Only" week. Just observe where the friction happens.

* If he forgets his shoes, move the shoes to the Launchpad.
* If breakfast takes too long, choose a faster "Menu" item.
* Adjust the "scaffold" until it feels stable.

### Summary: From Deficient to Architect

You are not "deficient" at structure; you are simply an architect who is building a better system. By using this external template, you are providing your son with the precise environment he needs to feel safe and successful, while protecting your own energy.
