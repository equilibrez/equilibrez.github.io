For a high-sensitivity system—especially one navigating ADHD or the lingering effects of high-stress environments—the bedroom is more than just a place to sleep. It is the **Primary Recovery Zone.** When the nervous system is prone to "Structural Bracing" or "Cache Overload" during the day, the sleep environment must be engineered to provide **Zero Input.** Any sensory noise (light, heat, or sound) can trigger the brain to resume "Scanning Mode," leading to vivid dreams or restorative failure.

This checklist is a mechanical guide to creating a "Read-Only" sanctuary.

### 1. The Thermal Override (Core Cooling)

Biological systems require a drop in core temperature to initiate deep, non-REM sleep. If the environment is too warm, the brain stays in a state of "High Heat," which fuels intense processing and vivid dreams.

* **Target Temperature:** Ideally **18°C (64°F)**.
* **The Mechanic:** Use cotton or linen fabrics that allow for heat dissipation. If you’ve consumed stimulants (like chocolate or caffeine), your internal "radiator" is already running hot; a cold room is a necessary counter-measure.

### 2. The Visual Firewall (Zero Light Input)

Even with eyes closed, the brain can detect light through the eyelids. Light is a "Data Packet" that tells the brain to stay alert.

* **Total Blackout:** Use blackout curtains or a heavy eye mask.
* **Indicator Lights:** Cover small LED lights on chargers, monitors, or appliances with black tape.
* **The Digital Sunset:** Avoid screens 60 minutes before sleep. Blue light tells the system it is "Peak Processing Time," preventing the production of melatonin.

### 3. Auditory Neutralization (The Sound Floor)

Sudden noises (a car outside, a floorboard creaking) can trigger a "Threat Detection" response in a system used to being on alert.

* **White/Brown Noise:** Use a constant, neutral sound source to raise the "sound floor." This masks unpredictable noises that might trigger a startle reflex.
* **Earplugs:** For high-noise environments, physical barriers are the most reliable method to ensure "Silent Input."

### 4. The Sensory "Launchpad" (Closing the Day)

To prevent the brain from "looping" on the day’s data, you must perform a physical closing ceremony.

* **Clothing Shift:** Change into dedicated sleep clothes. This is a sensory signal that the "Work/Defense" mode is officially offline.
* **Clear the Surface:** Ensure the bedside table is clear of "reminders." No bills, no lists, and no devices that might prompt a "Search" for information.

### 5. Summary: The Purpose of the Sanctuary

By treating your bedroom as a **Sanctuary of Zero Input**, you give your brain the permission to stop "Scanning." When the external environment is perfectly stable and predictable, the internal system can finally move from "Defensive" to "Deep Maintenance."

The goal is to wake up with a **Clean Mind**, ready to face the new day from a position of structural stability.
