When living with ADHD or PTSD, your "internal manager" can often be overloaded by high-entropy inputs. This handbook serves as your **External Scaffolding**. It consolidates the mechanical protocols we have developed into a single reference guide to help you maintain your "Pocket of Order."

### I. The Environmental Scaffold (Managing the External)

The goal is to move the "Work" of organization out of your brain and into your physical space.

#### 1. The Morning Scaffold (The Map)

* **The Launchpad:** A dedicated spot by the door for bags, keys, and Go equipment.
* **The Wearable Sequence:** Clothes laid out in order the night before.
* **The Visual Checklist:** A printed list on the wall to guide you through Fuel, Maintenance, and Armor.

#### 2. The Sanctuary Protocol (The Sleep Firewall)

* **Target Temperature:** 18°C (64°F) to ensure a drop in core temperature.
* **Zero Light Input:** Blackout curtains and covered LEDs to prevent "Visual Data Packets."
* **The Sound Floor:** Constant brown or white noise to neutralize unpredictable auditory triggers.

### II. The Somatic Scaffold (Managing the Physical)

When "Structural Bracing" occurs, use these mechanical overrides to signal safety to the nervous system.

#### 1. The Thermal Brake

* **Action:** Splash ice-cold water on the face or wrists.
* **Result:** Triggers the Mammalian Dive Reflex to immediately lower heart rate and waste heat.

#### 2. The Respiratory Brake

* **Action:** 4-count inhale, 8-count slow exhale.
* **Result:** Manually shifts the system from "Defensive" to "Maintenance" mode.

#### 3. The Structural Release (Stretching)

* **Doorway Stretch:** Opens the chest to reverse the "defensive hunch."
* **Psoas Lunge:** Releases the deep "running" muscles where adrenaline is stored.

### III. The Metabolic Scaffold (Managing the Chemical)

How to handle the "High-Heat" generated by late-night stimulants or stress.

#### 1. The Hydration Flush

* **Input:** 300–500ml room-temperature water.
* **Result:** Assists the kidneys in clearing theobromine and caffeine, cooling the internal engine.

#### 2. Thermal Neutralizers

* **Input:** Magnesium-rich or high-water-content foods (cucumber, celery).
* **Result:** Reduces the "Mechanical Work" done by the heart and metabolism.


### Summary: Operating the System

You are an **Architect** of your life. By using this handbook, you are building a world that accommodates your system, designing your own environment. When the environment is stable, you can focus on : mapping, integrating, sharing, and creating. Living a rich life.
